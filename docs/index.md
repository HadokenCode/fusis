# What is Fusis?

Fusis brings you a pleasant experience when configuring your balancing, by providing you a simple HTTP API for managing your services and destinations. It also provides network configuration, meaning that it will set up your network correctly to enable the Layer 4 balancing. For those how sometimes tried to do that knows how is a pain to make it work properly.
